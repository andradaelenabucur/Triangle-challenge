# Welcome to the Triangle challenge

I recommend using `Visual Studio Code` editor. Make sure you have added the `ESLint` exension and that eslint.enable is set to true in user settings. 

Run `npm install` to install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json

Run `npm start` to check the triangle type

Run `npm test` to run tests
